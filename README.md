## **User Experience (UX)**

### **Initial Concept**

From a visual perspective, the design of the website is intended to evoke the beauty of nature. A soft color palette of greens and blues was chosen to represent earthy and natural tones. The visual design is minimalist and clean, further emphasising the connection to nature. Each product range focuses on a key natural ingredient, prominently featured in the images. By incorporating nature-inspired visuals and a user-friendly interface, my intention is to make navigating the site feel like a walk through a botanical garden.
