## **Introduction** <!-- omit in toc -->

Welcome to the testing documentation for the Flora & Fauna e-commerce website. This document outlines the testing strategy and practices used to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.

The types of tests performed include automated testing using Django's built-in test suite. Code validation to ensure that the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python code adhere to best practices and standards. Colour contrast checks to verify that the text is easily readable and meets accessibility standards. Additionally, site performance is assessed using Lighthouse testing, and thorough manual tests are conducted to identify and rectify any issues.

The goal of this approach is to deliver the highest quality website achievable within my capabilities.
